INTRODUCTION
------------

The Administration Menu module displays the entire administrative menu tree
(and most local tasks) in a drop-down menu, providing administrators one- or
two-click access to most pages.  Other modules may also add menu links to the
menu using hook_admin_menu_output_alter().

FAQ
---

Q: I do not receive messages when I am offline. Is this normal?

A: Yes, Quap is a livechat to collect as little data as possible.

Q: I changed my device and now I don't see my messages. Have they been deleted?

A: Your messages are only stored on your device and give you absolute control over your data. 
   The ability to transfer your messages to another device is currently under development.


The Outlook
-----------

This project is currently still under development.

* Planned features are:
  - decentralized data synchronization
